## **Determining User Interaction with Apps in Google Play and Apple Store Markets**
### Objective:
The goal of this project is to use Python and Jupyter Notebook to pull and extract data from both Google Play and the App Store. The analysis aims to provide insights for developers who are interested in creating apps and generating revenue by understanding the factors that attract users.
 *Project was created with Dataquest.io, along with .csv files.*

###### The purpose of this project is to help developers understand which apps are more likely to attract users by analyzing the given data.

**Our criteria for said success can be determined as follows:**

1. Create a minimal Android version of application and add it to Google Play.
2. App will be developed further IF it gets a good response from users.
3. If app continues to be profitable after 6 months, an iOS version will be built and added to the App store.


## Key Tasks:

### 1. Data Collection:
∘ Utilize Python libraries (e.g., Pandas) to scrape and collect data from Google Play and the App Store.

∘ Extract relevant information such as app name, category, rating, reviews, installs, pricing, and more.

### 2. Data Cleaning:
∘ Handle missing data, duplicate entries, and outliers to ensure the dataset's integrity.

∘ Convert data types as needed and standardize formats for consistency.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
∘ Perform EDA to understand the distribution and characteristics of the collected data.

∘ Visualize key metrics using libraries like Matplotlib.

### 4. App Categories Analysis:
∘ Determine the most popular app categories on both platforms.

∘ Analyze the distribution of app ratings and reviews across different categories.

### 5. User Engagement Analysis:
∘ Investigate factors influencing user engagement, such as the number of installs, ratings, and reviews.

∘ Identify trends in user preferences within specific app categories.

### 6. App Store vs. Google Play Comparison:
∘ Compare the app ecosystems of Google Play and the App Store.

∘ Identify similarities and differences in user preferences and behavior.

### 7. Conclusion and Recommendations:
∘ Summarize key findings and insights from the analysis.

∘ Provide actionable recommendations for developers looking to create successful apps.

### Tools Used:
∘ Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

∘ Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome:
The project will result in a comprehensive analysis report and visualizations that developers can use to make informed decisions when creating and marketing their apps. The insights gained will contribute to understanding user preferences, optimizing pricing strategies, and ultimately increasing the likelihood of attracting users and generating revenue in the competitive mobile app market.
