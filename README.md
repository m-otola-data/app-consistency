## **Determining User Interaction with Apps in Google Play and Apple Store Markets**

 *Project was created with Dataquest.io, along with .csv files.*

###### The purpose of this project is to help developers understand which apps are more likely to attract users by analyzing the given data.

**Our criteria for said success can be determined as follows:**

1. Create a minimal Android version of application and add it to Google Play.
2. App will be developed further IF it gets a good response from users.
3. If app continues to be profitable after 6 months, an iOS version will be built and added to the App store.
